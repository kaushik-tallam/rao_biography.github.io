  "afternote": "“He had started this journey with nothing in his pocket and had established a name for himself that will be remembered for years to come. He touched the lives of many people in his life including his family, friends, business associates, employees and several others. He never backed down and was always present when someone he knew needed help of any sort. He was passionate, compassionate, soft-spoken, loving and caring. All of this was possible because he had a personality and a charm that always garnered unwavering support and respect from anyone and everyone that ever encountered him. He had a ton of confidence and willpower in everything that he ever did, which also helped him fight cancer for more than three years. He had a wonderful adventure filled with passion and love, and now he rests in peace, watching from above, all that he had built and left behind. The void that is now in his place can never ever be filled and he will always be remembered as a caring husband, a loving father, a passionate businessman, a helping hand and a leader.”",
